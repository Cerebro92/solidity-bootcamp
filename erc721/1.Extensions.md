# ERC721 Extensions

This page highlights some popular extensions of ERC721 interface.



## ERC721URIStorage

Base ERC721 implementation stores baseURI in storage and use it and tokenId to generate tokenURI in memory for a specific token.

```bash
tokenURI = string(abi.encodePacked(baseURI, tokenId.toString()))
```

ERC721URIStorage extension provides a mechanism to store token URIs in on-chain storage. So, instead of using same baseURI for all tokens, we can use entirely different URI for different tokens. However, since we are keeping tokenURIs data on-chain, this makes it storage inefficient.

## ERC721Pausable

This extension provides an additional functionality of pausing & resuming the transfer for tokens. The contract does not include public function to pause the contract, so subclasses will need to implement this.

Note that, ERC721Pausable contract restricts mint, burn and transferring of tokens. It does not stop owners from approving the tokens.
