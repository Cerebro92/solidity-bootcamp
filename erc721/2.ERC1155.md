# ERC1155

ERC1155 standard helps build fungibility-agnostic and gas-efficient token contracts. With the help of the ERC1155 standard, we can create fungible and non-fungible tokens using a single smart contract so, that we do not need to manage two different contracts to handle different types of assets. Also, since it provides batch operations for bulk transfer and querying multiple balances, that make it simpler and less gas-intensive.


### Differences between ECR721 and ERC1155

1.  __Ease of Use__
In the case of the ERC721 standard, Individual smart contracts are required for each token type. So, If multiple tokens need to be supported, they will have to deploy a separate contract for each token type. On the other hand, the ERC1155 token standard enables contract support for multiple token types with a single contract.


2. __Batch Transfers__
ERC721 standard does include methods for batch transfers of tokens. So, if we have to transfer multiple tokens, we will need to create a new transaction for each token.
whereas ERC1155 supports batch transfer making it gas-efficient.


3. __Conversion between Fungible and Non-Fungible token__
With the help of ERC1155, it is possible to convert fungible tokens to non-fungible tokens and vice-versa.
